WELCOME TO ALPHATIUS
In case you haven't caught on yet, Alphatius is a multiplayer-oriented PVP mod (or "modification") for the classic DOOM engine (idTech 1).
This zip file here contains everything you need to get started. Alphatius was made by auratoostronk: however, it would not be possible
without the help of Q-Zandronum - the engine that runs Alphatius; and Doomseeker - the server browser that Q-Zandronum uses.
Check out their websites!

HOW TO PLAY
Run play-solo.bat to practice with bots offline or to play the tutorial.                                                   
Run browse-servers.bat to browse online servers for Alphatius.
Run host-server.bat to host a server.

COMMON ISSUES
If you try connecting to a server, and your game boots up, but freezes on a stale screen of tiny text, this likely means either your Q-Zandronum version is out of date, or the server's Q-Zandronum version is out of date. If you re-download this package and it still doesn't work, try visiting https://qzandronum.com/ and overwrite the old files in the QZandronum folder with the new ones. If all else fails, let us know in the discord linked below.
