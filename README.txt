File updated for alphatius-qz-023

IMPORTANT INFO FOR BOTH PLAYERS AND SERVER HOSTERS
-This mod was made for Q-Zandronum and DOOM2.wad/Freedm.wad. It most likely won't work for any other ports or IWADS.
-Please note that it is strongly recommended to play ALPHATIUS using OpenGL as your renderer.
	This can be done by going to Options > Set Video Mode > Renderer and setting it to OpenGL.
	Some older computers cannot use this option and can cause Q-Zandronum to crash on startup.
	Do so at your own risk, or fix/delete your zandronum .ini file if anything goes wrong.
-This mod was designed with its own, built-in maps in mind. Doom II/FreeDM maps were not designed for
	Alphatius's gameplay. Any additional maps added by addons or anything of the sort that are
	designed for Alphatius are okay, but don't be suprised if they don't work as well, or break
	the game.
-This mod was designed to be a STANDALONE mod. If you try to run this with other mods,
	there's no guarantee that it will work. This includes map packs, weapon mods,
	other standalone mods, etc. Be reasonable if you want to ask me to make it compatible
	with a certain mod, because if you mention any of these kinds of mods, I will most likely say "no".
	However, small patches, like newtextcolours_260.pk3 or other small additions should be fine.
-This mod was developed by hiimaura. However, many of the resources came from many different sources.
	The credits can be found in CREDITS.txt, or alongside their respective resources in the .pk3 file.

	DEATHMATCH
