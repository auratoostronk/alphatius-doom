version alphatius-qz-release (9/24/23)

CONCEPT
Alphatius was only an idea in late 2016, during a dark time in my life where I was placed in a pseudo-boarding school
for "troublemaking children". I had no internet, no electronics, and not much else to do besides daydream about
what I wanted to do when I came home. One of these things I thought about was a DOOM mod. It had no name, but the
initial concept took inspiration from a few different mods and video games. I thought of weapon ideas,
action abilites, travel abilites, maps, and drew all this stuff out on paper. I started putting it together the moment
I returned home in the Summer of 2017. Although many of the original concepts for the mod were scrapped (like reloading, some weapon ideas, etc.),
Alphatius evolved into something unique and special. After many years of work it became one of the first creations
that I've felt sufficiently proud of myself for making. It helped me regain confidence in myself, and in my game design skills.
Going over six years strong, developing Alphatius has been my favorite passion, (alongside playing it of course),
and something many people also enjoy.
